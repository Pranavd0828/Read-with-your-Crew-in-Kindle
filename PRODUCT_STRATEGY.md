# Product Strategy

## What Is It
Read with your Crew in Kindle is a social reading prototype designed to make daily reading a shared habit. It transforms the solitary activity of reading on a Kindle into a collective experience. Users form small groups or "crews" to track their daily reading goals together. The core mechanic is simple. If you read your daily quota, you keep your streak alive. If you invite friends, you keep the group streak alive together.

## Why Build This
Reading is often an aspirational habit that people struggle to maintain. Most reading apps are solitary and purely functional. They lack the social accountability that makes fitness apps like Strava or Duolingo successful. We believe that adding a layer of social proof and gamification to the reading experience will help users read more books. We want to turn "I should read" into "I read today."

## Why Streak
The streak is the most powerful psychological hook for habit formation. It creates a daily urgency that helps users prioritize reading amidst their busy schedules. A group streak amplifies this effect. No one wants to be the person who breaks the chain for everyone else. This shared responsibility fosters a stronger commitment than individual willpower alone.

## Why Now
Digital reading is mature, but social reading is stagnant. People share book recommendations on TikTok or Goodreads, but the act of reading remains isolated. At the same time, users are craving more meaningful digital connections that go beyond passive scrolling. A platform that unites friends around intellectual growth and shared stories fits perfectly into this cultural moment.

## How It Works
We are building a lightweight web prototype that mimics the familiar Kindle interface to reduce friction.
1.  **The Library**: Users see their current books in a clean and distraction-free grid.
2.  **The Reader**: A simulated e-reader experience allows users to read real text. It verifies that they are actually reading by measuring the time spent on each page.
3.  **The Crew**: A dashboard shows who has read today and who needs a nudge. Privacy controls allow users to keep their book titles hidden while still sharing their progress.
4.  **The Celebration**: Completing the daily goal triggers a rewarding visual celebration to reinforce the habit loop.
